# seedgenerator
This is actually a proof of concept for a seed code generator for a laravel project we worked on. Instead of manually coding seeds for have a hug recordset for test, one should only upload an excel file and the the seed code are generated. This result into creating a new file called seed.php prepopulated with the seed codes. This code took me 10 minutes which should have taken 3 days if i were to write this code manually.

1. Make sure you set proper permission in your app directory for file creation.
2. Ensure the sample_data.csv is in same directory as your application. (not really compulsory, just incase you are having issues)
3. You can tweak code to reduce the size of file
4. Buy me bear if you find it useful
