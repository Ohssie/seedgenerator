# seedgenerator
This is actually a proof of concept for a seed code generator for a laravel project we worked on. Instead of manually coding seeds for have a hug recordset for test, one should only upload an excel file and the the seed code are generated. This result into creating a new file called seed.php prepopulated with the seed codes.
