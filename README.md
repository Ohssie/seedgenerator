# seedgenerator
This is actually a proof of concept for a seed code generator for a laravel project we worked on. Instead of manually coding seeds for have a hug recordset for test, one should only upload an excel file and the the seed code are generated. This result into creating a new file called seed.php prepopulated with the seed codes. This code took me 10 minutes which should have taken 3 days if i were to write this code manually.
